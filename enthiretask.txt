1. Binary classifier that i have tested without giving any parameter :-
   1. Logistic regression
   2. Linear svc
   3. Decision tree classifier
   4. Bagging classifier
   5. Random forest
   6. Adaboost
   7. XG Boost
   8. K neighbour classifier
2. Among these linear svc give best result with test accuracy of 93 % 
3. Metric taken into account are : Accuracy , Recall , Precision and F1 score
4. To increase performance of linear svc model i tried to play with its parameter but default model gives best result
5. I have also tried to play with parameter  like learning rate , max_depth ,min_sample_split etc in other models like random forest
